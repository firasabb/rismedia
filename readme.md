# Firas Abbas RISMedia Exercise

The app architecture:

rismedia:

    controllers:
       Controller.php
    css:
       style.css
    js:
       csv.js
    log:
       first.log
       second.log
       third.log
       (These logs are generated by me and you can also generate yours)

    .htaccess
    .file.php
    .index.php
    readme.md

# Installation

You just need to move the folder to your htdocs if you are using XAMPP.

And then navigate by your browser to the project folder.

for example: http://localhost/rismedia/

And the .htaccess will load index.php automatically, it will also forbid the user from accessing controllers folder.


# Notes

* I developed this exercise as fast as I can.
* I used javascript to export CSV instead of PHP because it is much simpler. If I was going to fetch data from MySQL I would use PHP.
* This app will read only .log files from the logs folder. (Nothing was mentioned about MySQL in the exercise description)
* I user Materialize CSS instead of Bootstrap because I thought that it is the best for a project like this.
